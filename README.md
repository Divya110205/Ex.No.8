# Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

### Date :
### Reg. No: 212222230034 

## Aim:

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to transform a portrait in classic realism into a stylized digital anime version while maintaining the subject’s expression and pose. The goal is to explore how prompt engineering can guide AI models in stylistic transformations.

## Procedure:

### 1.Analyze the Given Portrait:

● Note the character’s expression (smiling, serious, thoughtful).

● Observe the pose (head tilt, body angle, hand positioning).

● Identify physical details (hair color, eye shape, clothing, accessories).

● Recognize the lighting (soft, dramatic, natural) and background.

### 2.Create the Basic Prompt:

● Start with a simple description of the portrait, e.g.,

"A realistic portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, looking directly at the viewer."

### 3.Refine the Prompt with Anime Stylization:

● Add instructions for anime transformation, e.g.,

"An anime-style digital illustration of a young woman with long brown hair, looking directly at the viewer, maintaining her calm expression and seated pose."

### 4.Specify Artistic Style and Details:

● Choose an anime substyle (e.g., Studio Ghibli, modern digital anime, manga line-art).

● Example refinement:

"A vibrant anime-style illustration with large expressive eyes, clean digital shading, and pastel tones, capturing the same calm expression and seated pose as the original portrait."

### 5.Fine-Tune for Accuracy:

● Add details about clothing, background, or mood if important.

● Example:

"A digital anime artwork of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a white blouse, sitting with a calm expression, soft glow lighting, background kept minimal for focus."

### 6.Generate the Image:

● Use AI tools such as DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney with the crafted prompt.

### 7.Compare with the Original:

● Check whether the expression and pose are preserved.

● Assess anime stylization quality (eye size, line sharpness, shading).

● Refine the prompt if necessary.

## Tools/LLMs for Image Generation:
● DALL·E (by OpenAI) – Effective for prompt-driven transformations.

● Stable Diffusion – Flexible, allows fine-tuning and style guidance.

● MidJourney – Strong in creative anime-style outputs.

## Instructions:

● Examine the portrait and extract key features.

● Write an initial prompt describing the subject.

● Refine the prompt by adding anime stylistic details.

● Input into the chosen AI model.

● Iterate until the generated anime image preserves expression and pose.

● Save both original and stylized versions.

## Deliverables:

1.Original Portrait Image (realistic version).

2.Final Anime-Stylized Image (generated).

3.Prompts Used (initial → refined).

## Conclusion:

This experiment highlights how AI image generation tools can stylize a realistic portrait into an anime version while preserving key character traits such as expression and pose. Success depends on crafting precise prompts, specifying the desired anime style, and iterative refinement. This demonstrates the potential of AI for artistic reinterpretation and creative media applications.
