# Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

### Date :
### Reg. No: 212222230034 

## Aim:

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to transform an existing image (daytime city skyline) into a stylized version (neon-lit cyberpunk night scene) while preserving key elements such as skyline structure and composition.

## Procedure:

### 1. Analyze the Given Image:

Objects/Subjects: Buildings, skyscrapers, streets, bridges, cityscape.

Colors: Original daytime palette (sky blue, grey, and neutral building colors).

Textures: Smooth surfaces, glass reflections on buildings.

Lighting: Natural daylight with shadows.

Background: Clear sky, horizon visible.

Composition: Skyline with identifiable landmarks, horizon line clear.

Style: Realistic photography.

### 2. Create the Basic Prompt:

“A city skyline with skyscrapers and streets during the day.”

### 3. Refine the Prompt with More Detail:

“A city skyline with tall skyscrapers, streets below, and a clear sky, captured from a distance in daytime.”

### 4. Identify Style and Artistic Influences:

Target style: Cyberpunk, neon-lit, futuristic night scene.

Artistic references: Blade Runner aesthetic, neon reflections, moody night atmosphere.

### 5. Adjust and Fine-tune Prompt:

“A futuristic cyberpunk city skyline at night, with neon lights in pink, blue, and purple illuminating the skyscrapers, wet reflective streets below, glowing holographic signs, atmospheric fog, and a dramatic dark sky. Maintain the original skyline structure and perspective, emphasizing futuristic reflections and glowing details.”

### 6. Generate the Image:

Use DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney.

Input the refined prompt and generate multiple variations if possible.

### 7. Compare the Generated Image with the Original:

Check if:

Skyline structure matches the original daytime photo.

Neon lights and cyberpunk elements are correctly applied.

Reflections, fog, and atmospheric effects are realistic.

Colors and lighting give a night-time cyberpunk feel.

### 8. Iterate and Adjust:

If needed, refine prompt:

“Increase neon glow intensity, add more futuristic holographic billboards, slightly foggy atmosphere, and reflections on buildings and streets.”

### 9. Save and Document:

Save the final AI-generated image.

Document the prompt iterations and observations.

## Tools/LLMs for Image Generation:
● DALL·E (by OpenAI): A text-to-image generation tool capable of creating detailed images from textual prompts. ○ Website: DALL·E 

● Stable Diffusion: An open-source model for generating images from text prompts, known for its flexibility and customizable outputs. ○ Website: Stable Diffusion 

● MidJourney: A popular AI tool for generating visually striking and creative images based on text descriptions. ○ Website: MidJourney

## Deliverables:

1.Original Image: Provided daytime city skyline.

2.Final Generated Image: Neon-lit cyberpunk night scene with the skyline preserved.

3.Prompts Used:

Basic Prompt: “A city skyline with skyscrapers and streets during the day.”

Refined Prompt: “A futuristic cyberpunk city skyline at night, with neon lights in pink, blue, and purple illuminating the skyscrapers, wet reflective streets below, glowing holographic signs, atmospheric fog, and a dramatic dark sky. Maintain the original skyline structure and perspective.”

## Conclusion:
By carefully analyzing the original image and iteratively refining the prompt, text-to-image AI models can transform a daytime city skyline into a visually compelling cyberpunk night scene while preserving the original composition. Prompt specificity in terms of lighting, colors, reflections, and atmosphere is key to achieving realistic and stylistically accurate results.
